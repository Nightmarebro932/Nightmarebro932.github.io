# Why gardfeld rage quit is likley to move to another url, likley nightmarebro932.github.io/whygardfeldragequit so that I can make this a hub for all my projects and fuckery with html and my tests with css, javascript, java and maybe, MAYBE some things for portal 2 like changing small aspects like the menus 

# What is this?
This is a website where you must guess why gardfeld rage quit! (https://nightmarebro932.github.io)
# Roadmap
I want to add more to this and be something that updates constantly but first everything needs a LOT more polish, I made this in 3 minutes in school so its literally just a basic html file I made ON A CHROMEBOOK
- I would first like to focus on minor things like regular updates and basic development (the structure is done but I don't yet have a full picture of what I want this to becomes
- I want the final template to be like a test, click on what your guess is and then the website will reveal the answer
- This isn't exactly relevant but I'd like to get some friends of mine to fact check each guess and add to the html
