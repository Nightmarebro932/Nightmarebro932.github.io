# What is this?
This is a (well its supposed to be when I'm done) website where you must guess why gardfeld rage quit!
# Roadmap
I want to add more to this and be something that updates constantly but first everything needs a LOT more polish, I made this in 3 minutes in school so its literally just a basic html file I made ON A CHROMEBOOK
- I want the text to be centered and look nicer
- Eventually there will hopfully be some css for more fancy stuff
- I want the final template to be like a test, click on what your guess is and then the website will reveal the answer
- This isn't exactly relevant but I'd like to get some friends of mine to fact check each guess and add to the html
